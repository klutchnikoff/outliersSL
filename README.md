# robustSL

## Presentation

This package implements the clustering algorithm proposed in Klutchnikoff, Poterie, Rouvi√®re (2020).
Based on a new interpretation of the dendrogram produced by the AHC (in term of minimal distance) it can be viewed as a robust version of the single linkage algorithm.
(see arxiv://xxxxx for more details.)
